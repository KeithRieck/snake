# snake
This is a simple [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game using the [bedlam](https://github.com/KeithRieck/bedlam) game framework.

The program was written in Python and compiled with [Transcrypt](https://transcrypt.org/).

My goal with this was to create a game that was really abstract and _minimal_. Which is why there are no instructions, no decorations; nothing much there.  I added score keeping, since everyone wants to know how well they did, but even the score just shows up occassionally.
